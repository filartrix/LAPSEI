## Laboratorio di Architetture e Programmazione dei Sistemi Elettronici Industriali 
Material for the LAPSEI/LABARCH course
This repository contain some of the code examples that eare used for the course og the University of Bologna -  DEI.
More info about the course can be found here: [http://www-micrel.deis.unibo.it/LABARCH/] (http://www-micrel.deis.unibo.it/LABARCH/)
Each folder has a progressive number and contains the code seen during lesson.
The code has been written for STM32F401C Discoveery board, altough it can be easily ported to NUCLEO-F401RE STM32, editing only startup file and linker scritp
Each exercise folder contains only the user code, the STM32 Standard Peripheral Library is kept in a separate folder called _stm32f401c-disco_stdperiph_lib_**.
It is ncessary to add the standard Peripheral library to your project to compile correctly. You can add the Standard Peripheral library as rource of your project, or compile it as library and add it as a .a library
